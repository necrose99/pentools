This repository is just a dumping place for me to put various scripts
and tools that help me perform penetration testing and vulnerability 
scanning. Some of them are kinda cool, some of them are kinda dumb,
but they're handy at times.

My main goal is to put code I find useful someplace other than on
my own gear, since I tend to rebuild frequently, and suck at making
sure I've kept all my crap so that I have it after I'm done.

Everything I put here is released under the GPL.
(see file: COPYING for more information on that.)
If you'd like to contribute, be aware of that, and if
you're cool with releasing your contribution under the
same, it'll be added.
